Description: # Provenance JSON Parser
        `ProvParser` parses CDM (E3) JSON provenance data into edge-list format.
        Please use CamFlow parser to parse CamFlow data, instead of `ProvParser`, as the former is constantly updated as CamFlow evolves.
        
        `ProvParser` parses all segmented datasets (suffixed `.<NUMBER>` in file names) together so that (hopefully) no unmatched subject/object `UUID`s (many unmatches still exist, unfortunately; those cases are logged in `error.log`). `ProvParser` employs a key-value database (i.e., `RocksDB`) due to memory constraint of parsing large files (100+GB). 
        
        `ProvParser` parses JSON in a streaming fashion using `ijson`.
        It also employs a series of other existing `python` packages to improve performance, including standard `python` packages such as `multiprocessing`.
        
        > :warning: `ProvParser` depends on older versions of some external `python` packages. `ProvParser` is no longer actively supported or updated.
        
        ## Prerequisite
        All pure `python` dependencies have already been included in `setup.py` and therefore will automatically be installed in the working environment when `ProvParser` is installed.
        We have yet encountered any backward compatibility issues so far.
        
        However, the following packages are required to be pre-installed before running `ProvParser`:
        - YAJL (Yet Another Json Library)
        - RocksDB
        
        **Optional**:
        Installing `kCacheGrind` is optional. You should install it only if you want to profile and visualize the performance of `ProvParser`.
        
        ### Installation
        The following commands should guide you to install all the required and optional (only on Linux) packages on different OS.
        
        #### macOS
        Note: HomeBrew is required to run the following commands.
        
        ```
        brew install yajl
        brew install rocksdb
        ```
        > :warning: macOS installation instructions may be outdated.
        
        #### Ubuntu Linux (Latest Update: Aug 23, 2020)
        ```
        # Install YAJL
        sudo apt-get install libyajl2
        # Install RocksDB 5.14.3 backend
        git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
        cd rocksdb
        git checkout v5.14.3
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        sudo make install INSTALL_PATH=/usr
        # Install Ubuntu packages for Python RocksDB frontend
        sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev
        # (Optional) Install kcachegrind
        sudo apt-get install kcachegrind
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        `ProvParser` is easy to install. The following commands also create a virtual environment so you can safely install `ProvParser` and its dependencies.
        Note that `ProvParser` is **not** available on PyPI. Please download or `git clone` our source code first, before running the following commands.
        Assume now you are about to `cd` into the top-level directory `ProvParser`.
        
        ```
        cd ProvParser
        virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 testenv
        source testenv/bin/activate
        # We have to downgrade pip to 18.1 to allow `--process-dependency-links` option
        pip install pip==18.1
        pip install -e . --process-dependency-links
        ```
        
        ## Run
        `ProvParser` is a commandline tool, run:
        ```
        provparser -h
        ```
        
        ## Issue
        - [ ] FiveDirections data is very dirty. `ta1-fivedirections-e3-official` contains trailing comas and un-namespaced record types.
